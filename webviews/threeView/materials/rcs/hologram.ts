 * Channel names come from the shader's own sampler table (see _channels.ts),
 * not from the texture filenames, which are unreliable.
 *
 * Permutation: the lit, Ambient, no-shadow, no-spot point of the matrix
 *   (see _abstract.ts). The others are TODO.
 *
 * TODO: this factory maps the material's texture channels onto a Phong
 *   approximation. The shader's own lighting maths has not been transcribed.
 *
 * Animated: the shader takes the engine's `time` uniform and offsets the
 * sample coordinate with it, so the texture channels scroll (see _animated.ts).
