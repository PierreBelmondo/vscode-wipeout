 *
 * Permutation: the lit, Ambient, no-shadow, no-spot point of the matrix
 *   (see _abstract.ts). The others are TODO.

 * TODO: this factory maps the material's texture channels onto a Phong
 *   approximation. The shader's own lighting maths has not been transcribed.
 *
 * Animated: the shader takes the engine's `time` uniform and modulates the
 * emissive term with it, so the glow pulses (see _animated.ts).
